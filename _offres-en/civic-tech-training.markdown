#### OSP TRAINING
It aims at raising awareness regarding civic tech and the different processes of citizen participation, as well as the issues and good practices of the sector (such as the promises and limits of participatory democracy, historical and comparative of online participation processes, organization of a budget participatory and so on).

#### WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH YOUR TEAMS.

Training is delivered by Valentin Chaput, who teaches at Sciences Po Lille and Saint-Germain-en-Laye (the impact of digital on democratic processes and public action), and Virgile Deville, who conducts trainings at Paris 8.
